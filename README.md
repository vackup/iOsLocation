Location
=========
 This is an iOS Location application that prints information about our current location: latitude, longitude, and other parameters to the screen. This application will demonstrate how to properly perform location updates while the application is either Active or Backgrounded.
 
It relates to the [Location Walkthrough](/guides/ios/application_fundamentals/backgrounding/part_4_ios_backgrounding_walkthroughs/location_walkthrough/) guide in the developer centre.
